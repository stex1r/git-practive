This is some
basic text.

It will be used to test
git strategies.


Hopefully, we'll think of something.
=========================
This text is added for feature 1 in 1st commit.
(feature 1: commit 1)

We will create merge request 
on feature-1 from now on, then we will fork feature-1
(that means create branch feature-2 from it).
But once we will fix some code in feature-1 - we'll get conflict.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This text is added for feature 2 in 1st commit.
It will not be conflicted, because
it does't intersect with initial feature-1 code.
